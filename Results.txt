1. I used PCA to reduce the features to n_components 
(which was decided by plotting the explained variance).

2. After reducing the #features, I used one class SVM linear
 kernel method for the classification. Since we have to classify
pikachu images from anything that is not pikachu.

True Positives: 44 
False Negatives: 0 
False Positives: 255 
True Negatives: 245

Accuracy: 0.53125

Sensitivity 1.0

Specificity 0.49

F1 Score:  0.07678883071553229

With limited data, the accuracy was not very good. 

By using 10-fold cross validation, the accuracy reached:
0.6911
